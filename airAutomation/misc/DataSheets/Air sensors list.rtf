The TSL2561 luminosity sensor is an advanced digital light sensor, ideal for use in a wide range of light situations. Compared to low cost CdS cells, this sensor is more precise, allowing for exact flux calculations and can be configured for different gain/timing ranges to detect light ranges from up to 0.1 - 40,000+ Lux on the fly. The best part of this sensor is that it contains both infrared and full spectrum diodes! That means you can separately measure infrared, full-spectrum or human-visible light. Most sensors can only detect one or the other, which does not accurately represent what human eyes see (since we cannot perceive the IR light that is detected by most photo diodes)\

Many of the sensors used in this project output an analogue signal. The Raspberry Pi cannot read these signals directly, so to convert these signals to digital, you need an ADC (analogue to digital converter). I recommend the MCP3008 which has 8 separate analogue inputs, so you only need one in order to read the values for all your sensors.\

or similar rather than the Raspberry PI. The reason for this thought is mostly because of the cost of the device. Since you can purchase an arduino for about half of the cost of the PI and can set it up on a net work for $17 using XBees it is a cheaper product that can preform what is needed. The Ras PI is a great option and lots of work has been done in this exact area with the Air PI but the cost factor makes it a little less appealing if this were to become an actual product. We can further discuss this as a team though. \

Description: \
This is a breakout board for Honeywell\'92s HIH-4030 humidity sensor. The HIH-4030 measures relative humidity (%RH) and delivers it as an analog output voltage. You can connect the output of the sensor directly to an ADC on a micro controller; and, thanks to the sensor\'92s near linear voltage output, the data is very easy to process.\
*** This is a great and easy to use humidity sensor in case we go with the pressure and temperature sensor above. It will allow us to take a humidity reading easily and quickly.\

TGS 2600 - General Air Quality - Requires ADC \
*** I am unable to find this sensor in the US. I am not sure we need it for the project but it would handle a few different areas for the price of one. Maybe we can keep looking if it is necessary.\
\
This sensor responds to various gases associated with poor air quality and the presence of smoke including methane, iso-butane, ethanol and hydrogen. It consists of a 4 pin canister, 2 of which power the heating element for it (5V), and 2 of which are the connections to the sensing resistor (its resistance is proportional to the air quality). However, the output given by this sensor is analogue, so you needs an ADC (see above) to use it properly.\
\'95 Output is analogue, will require an ADC\
